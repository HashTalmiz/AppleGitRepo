# PreScripted (MiniHack-1)
### The Web App which keeps a record of Prescriptions for Doctors and their patients
[Hosted here](https://affectionate-goldwasser-3b8ad5.netlify.com)
#### About:
This Web app is used for patients who can keep a track of their prescriptions from various visits to their local clinic, and maintain a proper medical history of their intake of medicines.

As for Doctors,they can keep a track of their patient's medical history, dietary reccomendations given previously and provide accurate diagnosis with the prevention of medication allergies when prescribing the next set of medication.

Benifits:
* Keep a record of their prescriptions for their next visit to the pharmacy(Patients).
* Keep a record of a large number of patients without physical pen-and-parer documentation.
* Provide accurate diagnosis based on previous visits.
* Have proper knowledge of the patients medical history.

### IMPORTANT
Unfortunety due to the lack of back-end skilled developers, the project could not be complete, although, the front end of the entire website was made **Scratch** (without templates just to strengthen markup basics) and is completely **Resposive** to all mobile device sizes.
Ideally, this would have a login and sign up for both doctors and patients with a database collecting all of their prescription.
